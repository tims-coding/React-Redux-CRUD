# React Application with Redux Toolkit

Redux now has a toolkit which can reduce boilerplate code. This allows storing state and state management in general more simple and easier to digest. This React application performs CRUD operations on a Fake Data set that contains users. The users can be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD).

***Redux in the past has come with many challenges, which includes 
- Too much code to configure Store to optimized levels/best practices 
- Too much boilerplate code makes code less clean and efficient 
- Too many packages needed to install to build scalable apps 
- Writing actions and reducers becomes more complex and cumbersome in huge applications
